## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the world, and understanding its trends and patterns is crucial. This project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create interactive visualizations that help users comprehend the various aspects of the pandemic. This project is the visualization part of my other project [Covid-19-Data-Exploration.sql](https://github.com/NimratMudhar/Covid-19-Data-Exploration.sql). This is a dashboard made from the findings of my previous project i.e. [Covid-19-Data-Exploration.sql](https://github.com/NimratMudhar/Covid-19-Data-Exploration.sql). 
## Data Sources
